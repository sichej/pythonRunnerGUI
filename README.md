# pythonRunnerGUI

## Introduction

It's well known that Hackers hate using CLI (Command Line Interface).\
I know, I know, even for me it's hard hearing such a terrible word, so I needed to create something to avoid using CLI.\
So this is what I tought, mainly H4ckers use python, but as we sadly know to lauch python scripts it's necessary to use the infamous CLI.\
UNTIL NOW.

But now my dear Hackers nobody will stop us from using our dreamed and loved GUI, this tool is what we have been dreaming for years, finally a GUI for launching python scripts.

## How to use it

Just insert the file path inside the textBox and press the Big Green Button ```RUN``` and look at the output inside the other textBox.
